pixel art.py is the main file in this repo \n
main.py is simply a manual implementation that is impractical\n
Image can be easily edited by anyone \n

This was written in PyCharm but will work on any python IDE or python interpreter

Color images are possible but far too slow to be useful
Will explore CTurtle for a faster turtle
